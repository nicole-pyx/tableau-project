Data extrapolation on a Smart Home, using the sensors, to see if I can determine the lifestyle of a person living inside the house.
Questions to answer
1.	Which activity was recorded the most/least?
2.	What is the correlation between time and activity?
3.	What is the correlation between location and activity? 
4.	What is the correlation between sensor type and activity?
5.	What is the spread of activities for each sensor?


My Hypothesis
•	The bigger the house, the lesser the amount of data collected for the same number of sensors, because the sensor cannot detect far enough.
•	Least activity being recorded during sleeping hours.
•	Motion sensors will record the most activity.
